### Group Number:
3

### Project and Team Name:
Unison

### Project Description:
Unison is an online platform that offers musicians (producers, sound engineers, songwriters, vocalists, etc.) a cloud-based collaborative environment. It allows musicians to publicly or privately share their DAW-based projects (digital audio workstation) on the cloud, allowing anyone to edit their own version.

Features:
- Based on the Google Docs model, you can work directly on the online DAW platform to make live edits to projects.
- By making Unison compatible with most popular DAWs (FL Studio, Logic Pro, Ableton, GarageBand), Unison helps musicians working on different local platforms to merge their work into one single project on the cloud.
- Based on the GitHub model, you can pull pieces (plugin presets, .mp3 and .wav files, audio tracks, instruments, MIDI files, etc.) from online projects to add to your own local projects, or push pieces of your local projects to the cloud for others to work on.
- You can work on branches and versions of the same project and merge them into one final project.
