Overall Look and Feel of Unison
===============================
The website will have a minimalist and clean look. It will give off a modern atmosphere. We will avoid 3D buttons and anything that is too dynamic and distracting. We want our website to look simple, basic and for the user to navigate it with ease. We will not clutter it. 

The website should give off a vibe of calm confidence. The theme will be dark. We will mix black, white, and dark shades or purple and red to remind the user of technology and lights during a music concert.
