PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Our project is a platform (a website) which uses artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to assist you in finding a job. Based on the information that you give to the AI and based on multiple job descriptions, our platform will give you a list of the best jobs you should apply on (the jobs that matches best with the information you entered). The AI will then make a personalized resume and write a cover letter based on the employer needs/job description and on your past working experiences/interests/other factors. It will also predict your chances of getting selected based on the profile of the other people that work in that specific company.
