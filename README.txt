PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Unison is an online cross-compatible platform that offers musicians (producers, sound engineers, songwriters, vocalists, etc.) a cloud-based collaborative environment. It allows musicians to publicly or privately share their DAW-based projects (digital audio workstation) on the cloud, allowing anyone to edit their own version.

Features:
- By making Unison compatible with most popular DAWs (FL Studio, Logic Pro, Ableton, GarageBand), Unison helps musicians working on different local platforms to merge their work into one single project on the cloud.
- Unison converts local DAW files to a cross-compatible intermediary project using AI technology without loss of information. The intermediary project can be modified and improved by others on any DAW.
- Based on the GitHub model, you can pull intermediary projects from the cloud on the local DAW that you prefer, or push pieces of your local projects to the cloud for others to work on using their preferred DAW.
- You can work on branches and versions of the same project and merge them into one final project.
